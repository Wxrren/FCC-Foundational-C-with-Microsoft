# FCC-Foundational-C-with-Microsoft
A course I am taking through FreeCodeCamp. 

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to C# programming, covering its core concepts, syntax, and practical application in software development.

Through hands-on exercises and projects, you will learn the fundamentals of C#, including variables, data types, control structures, and object-oriented programming principles.

The course is made up of multiple exercises and project with an exam at the end.
